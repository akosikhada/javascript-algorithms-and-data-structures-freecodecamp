## üìö Course Descriptions

### üèõ Pyramid Generator

A project that builds a text-based pyramid generator using fundamental JavaScript concepts like arrays, strings, functions, loops, and conditional statements. This project strengthens algorithmic thinking by requiring the creation of nested loops to generate patterns of increasing and decreasing width.

### üìù GradeBook App

A mini-project reinforcing JavaScript fundamentals by building a gradebook application to manage and calculate student grades. This application processes student scores, computes averages, and assigns letter grades based on configurable grading scales.

### üõ° Role Playing Game

An interactive RPG demonstrating object-oriented programming concepts, game logic implementation, and event handling. Players navigate through multiple locations, battle monsters with different abilities, manage inventory items, and track game statistics like health and gold.

### üåà Random Color Changer

A project focusing on debugging techniques while implementing a random background color generator with DOM manipulation. This application generates random RGB or hexadecimal color values and applies them to page elements, featuring a clean user interface with color preview.

### ü•ó Calorie Counter

An application for tracking calorie intake with form validation, calculations, and dynamic UI updates. Users can input meals and their caloric content, set daily budgets, and visualize their remaining calorie allowance with input validation using regular expressions.

### ‚úÇÔ∏è Rock, Paper, Scissors Game

A classic game implementation showcasing conditional logic and DOM manipulation. Players compete against the computer, which makes randomized choices. The interface displays game outcomes, tracks scores, and offers a responsive design with animated elements for enhanced user experience.

### üéµ Music Player

A functional audio player with playlist management capabilities using the Web Audio API. Features include play, pause, skip, and shuffle controls along with a visual representation of the current track. The application demonstrates array methods for playlist manipulation and dynamic content rendering.

### üìÖ Date Formatter

A utility tool for handling and formatting dates in various international formats. This project explores the complexities of the JavaScript Date object, timezone handling, and string manipulation techniques to create a flexible date conversion system.

### ‚öΩ Football Team Cards

An interactive card display system for football team players. This application processes player datasets, implements filtering and sorting options, and demonstrates object destructuring techniques. The cards feature dynamic content updates and responsive layout adjustments.

### ‚úÖ Todo App

A complete task management application with data persistence using browser local storage. Users can create, read, update, and delete tasks while organizing them by priority or completion status. The interface includes dynamic filtering capabilities and visual indicators for task status.

### üö´ Spam Filter

A text analysis tool utilizing regular expressions to identify potential spam content in messages. This project explores advanced regex techniques like capture groups and lookaheads to analyze patterns in text, with confidence scoring for potential spam detection.

### #Ô∏è‚É£ Number Sorter

A visualization tool for fundamental sorting algorithms including bubble sort, selection sort, and insertion sort. The application provides step-by-step animation of algorithm execution, comparative performance metrics, and interactive controls to adjust sort parameters.

### üìä Statistics Calculator

A mathematical utility for performing statistical calculations on numerical datasets. Users can input collections of numbers to calculate mean, median, mode, variance, and standard deviation. The implementation showcases array methods like map, reduce, and filter with method chaining.

### ‚öôÔ∏è Spreadsheet

A simplified spreadsheet application with formula evaluation capabilities and cell references. This project demonstrates functional programming principles, expression parsing, and dynamic recalculation of dependent cells when values change.

### üõí Shopping Cart

An e-commerce cart system utilizing object-oriented programming principles. The application manages product catalogs, handles quantity adjustments, calculates totals with discounts, and simulates checkout processes while demonstrating class-based architecture.

### üéÆ PlatFormer Game

A side-scrolling platform game showcasing inheritance and advanced OOP concepts. The game implements character movement, physics (gravity, collision detection), level design, and scoring mechanics, with reusable component designs for game elements.

### üé≤ Dice Game

A strategic dice game with complex scoring rules and turn management. Players roll dice, make decisions based on current results, and compete for high scores. The game manages state transitions, validates moves, and provides an engaging user interface with animations.

### üë®‚Äçüíª fCC Authors Page

A web application that fetches and displays author data from an external API with pagination controls. This project demonstrates asynchronous JavaScript techniques, API interaction patterns, and dynamic content rendering with efficient data handling.

### üèÜ fCC Forum Leaderboard

A real-time leaderboard displaying forum activity metrics fetched from external APIs. The implementation features asynchronous data retrieval, error handling with try/catch statements, and automated refresh capabilities to keep the display current.

## üîÆ Future Courses

The remaining courses will cover a wide range of JavaScript concepts including:

- Audio manipulation and playback
- Date/time formatting
- Local storage
- API interactions with async JavaScript
- Sorting algorithms visualization
- Regular expressions
- Advanced OOP concepts
